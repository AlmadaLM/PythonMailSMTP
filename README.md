# PythonMailSMTP
Python code where you can send a mail from the code, maybe use it to automatize things.

Modify it as you need, changing ports or the server, I used the gmail one.
Also if you're using the gmail server you need to enable an option from the google account you're going to be using. Enabling "less secure app access" (old way) or 
using the 2-Step Verification, then using the App passwords function, so you can use it from there with that password.

For any doubts or suggestions send me a mail.
